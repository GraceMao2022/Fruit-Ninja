# Fruit Ninja

This is a Tiny-Graphics game based on Fruit Ninja. Fruits and bombs get thrown onto the screen, and the user swipes on the objects. If it is a bomb the game will end. If it is a fruit, the fruit will break into half, and a point is gained. The score will be kept in the corner. 

Playing the Game:
- To start or restart the game click the ‘enter’ (or return) button
- To gain points swipe the mouse over fruits (watermelon, orange, peach, apple, mango) 
- The game ends when the player clicks on a bomb

Sound effects: 
- Background music will play upon starting the game (click enter)
- When swiping on fruit successfully, a slash sound will play
- Swiping mouse on a bomb will trigger an explosion sound effect
